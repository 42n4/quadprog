This is an R port of the quadprog package version 1.2 of
Berwin A. Turlach <berwin.turlach@anu.edu.au> which can be found
at http://wilton.anu.edu.au/%7Eberwin/software/quadprog.html. An older
version can also be found in the statlib archive.

Changes from original:

	changed order of variables in declaration of subroutine aind
	from
		integer ind(m,*), m, q, n, i, j
	to
		integer m, ind(m,*), q, n, i, j
	because g77 complained. Made corresponding change in
	subroutine qpgen1 in solve.QP.compact.f.

	removed function ".First.lib"
