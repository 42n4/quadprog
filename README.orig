This library contains routines and documentation for solving quadratic
programming problems.

I implemented these routines (using the algorithm of Goldfarb and
Idnani, 1982, 1983) and decided to distribute them in the hope that
they may also be useful to others.  Hence, this software is provided
"as is" without any expressed or implied warranty.

The routines are released under the GNU Copyleft although I am not
sure whether it is applicable since at least the S-PLUS interface
works together with a commercial software.  But even if a distribution
under these terms is legally not allowed, I would like to ask you to
respect the spirit of the GNU Copyleft when using this code.

The complete distribution consists of the following files:

solve.QP.compact.f   fortran routine to solve a quadratic programming
                     problem where the matrix defining the constraints
                     is stored in a compact format.
solve.QP.f           fortran routine to solve a quadratic programming
                     problem. 
util.f               some fortran utility functions.
solve.QP.compact.d   S-PLUS help file for solve.QP.compact.
solve.QP.d           S-PLUS help file for solve.QP.compact.
QuadProg.q           the S-Plus functions of this library.
Makefile             a makefile which should facilitate the
                     installation of this library.
COPYING              GNU Copyleft (mentioned above).
README               short description of the routines of the library
                     (necessary to make `library(help=QuadProg)' work
                     in S-PLUS once the library is installed).
README.1st           you are just reading it ;-).
README.INSTALL       some information on how to install the library.
README.pd            README file which should go into the parent
                     directory of the QuadProg directory in which the
                     library resides in the end (necessary so that
                     `library()' will give the desired information in
                     S-PLUS).
ChangeLog            history of the development of this library.

If you have any troubles or if you find any bugs in this library,
please let me know and I will try to fix it.  I would also be
interested to hear from you if you find this library useful and for
what kind of problems you are using it.

Best wishes,
        
        Berwin
