	* Release 1.2 ready.

	* First.lib.template:
	Changed to Release 1.2 after recent bug fix in Fortran code and
	changes to S-plus interface and help files.

	* solve.QP.compact.sf:
	Added a Fortran routine that checks whether all elements of Aind which
	are accessed are valid.  Prior (S-plus coded) test was too crude and
	failed if constraints had different lengths and shorter constraints
	were filled up with zeros.

	* aind.f: Initial revision

	* solve.QP.sf, solve.QP.compact.sf:
	Deleted `miter' from parameter list as underlying Fortran code doesn't
	have it anymore.  Deleted all storage.mode commands and defined mode
	in call to Fortran routine (my preferred style these days).  Added
	checks whether dimensions of arguments are compatible and sensible.

	* solve.QP.d, solve.QP.compact.d:
	Reworded the help file and brought it closer to the style described in
	the complements of V&R 2nd ed.

	* solve.QP.f, solve.QP.compact.f:
	Deleted `miter' from parameter list and program as it is not
	necessary, was there for debugging reasons but annoys now.

	* solve.QP.f, solve.QP.compact.f:
	Fixed a bug, if an equality constraint is dropped and the sign of the
	normal vector changes, bvec() wasn't changed.

	* solve.QP.compact.sf, solve.QP.sf:
	Changed error message from "is singular" to "is not positive definite"

	* solve.QP.compact.f, solve.QP.f, solve.QP.sf, First.lib.template, solve.QP.compact.sf:
	Corrected address of Free Software Foundation
